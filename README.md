# Maze-Solver
this is a maze solver using python3 and tkinter to generate a GUI, randomly generate a maze, and then solve the maze

requires python 3.10 at a minimum and tkinter to be installed on your machine. I used python 3.12.3

Run the following commands in your terminal if you don't have them:

Python:

sudo apt-get install python3

Tkinter:

sudo apt-get install python3-tk
